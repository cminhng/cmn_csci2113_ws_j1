1. What is fault localization? 
    
    *When you locate where the faulty line of code is, typically using **print       statements, a debugger, or tracing**.* 

2. What are three benefits of Test Driven Development (TDD)? Provide your answer using an unordered list in markdown.

- *Your tests aren't "tainted" or influenced by your coding process.*
- *Writing tests helps you think about implementation.*
- *Writing tests helps you think about the requirements of your system*

3. Given the example of requirements for generating a password:
- It must have at least one number.
- It must have at least one uppercase letter.
- It must have at least one lowercase letter.
- It must not contain the website gmail anywhere. (For example if we were generating a password for gmail accounts)
- It can only be made up of letters, numbers, and the underscore.
   
What are the input domain partitions for this exercise? Provide your answer using an unordered nested lists in markdown.

- *has chars outside of letters, numbers, and the underscore (invalid)*
- *has only chars that are letters, numbers, and underscore*
  - *has the website gmail (invalid)*
  - *does not have the website gmail*
    - *has at least one lowercase letter*
      - 
    - *does not have at least one lowercase letter (invalid)*

4. Complete the truth table below to show what inputs we need to achieve active clause coverage for the following conditional:

5. Consider the control flow graph below. What are all the paths (using node numbers) that would achieve full path coverage as a test criteria? Is this a finite set?

6. What benefit does mutation testing offer over other testing methods discussed in class? Use a link in markdown to link to the definition of mutation testing we have in our lecture notes from today.
